**<ins>Bridge Question</ins>**  

Can you walk across each bridge once and only once? (able to start anywhere)

**<ins>Note</ins>**  

The question is not a geometric one, instead it's a relational question, which means the distance of the node or the angle of nodes doesn't count in this question.

**<ins>Sol.</ins>**  

No way to complete it. 

Since each node here has odd edges. If a node has odd edges, then it's impossible to start and end at the same dot.
