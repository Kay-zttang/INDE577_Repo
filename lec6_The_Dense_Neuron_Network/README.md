## The Dense Neuron Model

**- The Neuron Networks**
* 1 Input Layer + 1 sequence of Hidden Layer (multiple single nuerons) + 1 Output Layer
* Computational; highly composite
* Problem of latent overfitting
* Work Flow: (Iterate until arriving at an Output Value)

    Input Signal (feature measure) scaled by $\to$ 1st layer weights
    
    pass into $\to$ an activation function foward into $\to$ next layer
* Learning by <ins>minimizing the cost function</ins> by <ins>adjusting the Weights and Bias</ins> with some variant of <ins>gradient descent</ins>.
