# INDE577_Data Science and Machine Learning

The repository contains materials of implementations of the algorithms covered in course INDE577 along with relating data sets and descrptive README.md files.

### **- Supervised Learning**

Using observable pairs of Measurements *x* and Labels *y* as (x,y) to build a predictive model on other unknown pairs.
- Frame work: 
    - Training Examples 
    - Model Choosing and Learning Algorithm 
    - Hypothesis Set:
        All possible choices of weights and bias.
    - Final Hypothesis approximating Target Function:
        The weight and bias which make function approcimates *f*
- Loss Function(a.k.a Cost Function): Evaluate Model Hypothesis
- Underfitting and Overfitting Issues
    - Partition data sets as training / testing data sets
