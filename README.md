# INDE577_Data Science and Machine Learning

The repository contains materials of implementations of the algorithms covered in course INDE577 along with relating data sets and descrptive README.md files.

**Machine Learning**
* Supervised Learning
    Using observable pairs of Measurements$x$ and Labels$y$ as (x,y) to build a predictive model on other unknown pairs.
    - Frame work: 
        - Training Examples 
        - Model Choosing and Learning Algorithm 
        - Hypothesis Set
        - Final Hypothesis approximating Target Function
    - Loss Function: Evaluate Model Hypothesis
    - Underfitting and Overfitting Issues
        - Partition data sets as training / testing data sets
* Unsupervised Learning
